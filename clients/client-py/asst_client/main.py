# Automation Support Service Client [EXAMPLE]

# This realisation is only example how client can be builded.
# Here I tried to implement ClientWrapper which methods dynamically generated from ASST
# server's commands that allow to work with ASST server in easy and trancparent way.

    # will do what we want and will return answer. ClientWrapper will automatically wait for ASST answer.
